## v2.2.0 - 2025-01-23

- _ci-and-build_: Migrate to latest changie config, which should eliminate problems with go mod.
  Go modules seem to have issue in vendored supporting files having emoji in the file name.
  This will no longer occur with latest config.
- _ci-and-build_: Add goreleaser config for releasing library, eliminating the need to chain multiple commands together.
  Now, push an updated changelog file by using the changie-trigger-release, merge that PR, and and the release workflow will release and tag.
- _ci-and-build_: Remove vendor directory to support go work usage, which isolates the mage/build automation from the SBOM generation for the library.
- _new-product-feature_: added simple caching for access tokens
- _new-product-feature_: Add Azure authentication
- _dependencies_: Maintenance release due to updated dependencies.
